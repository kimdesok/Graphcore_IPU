# Graphcore IPU Projects: camelyon17-wilds image classification 
## Resnet18 model & datasets:
>* Resnet18 model was tried first, being the smallest kind, to test a train model, a validation model and their weight transfer between the corresponding wrappers
>* A set of small datasets were randomly selected from the original camelyon17-wilds to speed up the training and avoid the OOM.
>* Some design features:<br>
                  `Host model`<br>
